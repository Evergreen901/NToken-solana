# Nova finance nToken program


nAssets are Nova Financeâ€™s framework for building programmable assets. nAssets can be used to tokenize and store collective forms of value while also instructing assets to yield, exchange or rebalance. 



Within our Solana MVP, our first nAsset token type allows users to execute a simple hedge where they reduce their exposure to volatility of a cryptocurrency asset by converting and maintaining a % of the nAsset in stablecoin. This nAsset can protect users from downside risk and is a more efficient form of collateral as liquidation is much harder to achieve.



Going forward, we will be releasing portfolios and more complex programmable assets that take profit and redistribute when certain conditions are met. Follow our repository to stay updated!
